// write if else statements that check if the string in the

// that it is either missing the '@' sign or the '.' sign

// uncomment the variable that you want to test with
// let email = "peter@codecool.com" # should print 'valid email'
// let email = "peter.codecool.com" # should print 'missing at sign'
let email = "peter@codecool"     // should print 'missing dot sign'
