# write if else statements that check if the string in the
# variable 'email' is a valid and if not it should display
# that it is either missing the '@' sign or the '.' sign

# uncomment the variable that you want to test with
# email = "peter@codecool.com" # should print 'valid email'
# email = "peter.codecool.com" # should print 'missing at sign'
email = "peter@codecool"     # should print 'missing dot sign'
